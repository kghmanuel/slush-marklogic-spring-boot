# slush-marklogic-spring-boot [![NPM version](https://badge-me.herokuapp.com/api/npm/slush-marklogic-spring-boot.png)](http://badges.enytc.com/for/npm/slush-marklogic-spring-boot)

> Generator for Angular/Spring Boot/MarkLogic apps

This is similar to <a href="https://github.com/marklogic/slush-marklogic-node">slush-marklogic-node</a> (and the creators of that project did all the hard work, making it easy to create this project), but it's intended for MarkLogic users that prefer a Java middle tier (Spring Boot) instead of NodeJS. The Angular UI is largely the same (along with using bower/gulp/npm), and Gradle is the build tool instead of Roxy, though you can always use Maven to invoke Gradle too. 

## Prerequisites

To install and use slush-marklogic-spring-boot, you need a few things installed locally first (unless otherwise noted, install the latest version of each):

1. A [Java Development Kit (JDK) 1.7+ or 1.8+](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html) (needed to compile a small amount of Java code in the Spring Boot app, as well as run the Spring Boot app)
1. [Node 4.x+](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
1. [Slush](https://www.npmjs.com/package/slush)
1. [Bower](https://www.npmjs.com/package/bower)
1. [Gulp](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gulp)
1. [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) (required by Bower)
1. (Optional) [Gradle](http://gradle.org/gradle-download/). If you have Gradle already, great - use it - but be sure to only use Gradle 2! Gradle 3 and Spring Boot do not yet get along well. If you don't have Gradle installed already, you can use the [Gradle wrapper](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/gradle_wrapper.html) that's included in the generated project. Just run e.g. "./gradlew" instead of "./gradle".

## Getting Started

Install `slush-marklogic-spring-boot` globally:

```bash
$ npm install -g slush-marklogic-spring-boot
```

### Usage

Create a new folder for your project:

```bash
$ mkdir my-app
```

Run the generator from within the new folder:

```bash
$ cd my-app && slush marklogic-spring-boot
```

As of version 0.1.x, the generator will install Bower and Node dependencies for you. 
It doesn't yet deploy the MarkLogic application or build the webapp. It also assumes
that your admin username/password is admin/admin. If you need to modify that, first do so in the gradle.properties file. Then run these commands (note that 0.1.x doesn't have the Gradle wrapper yet either):

    gradle mlDeploy
    gulp build

Once you've run those, you can launch Spring Boot via the command line:

    gradle bootRun

Or, since you have a Java middle tier, you'll probably want to load the project into
an IDE like Eclipse and run Spring Boot from there:

    gradle eclipse

And then import the project and run "org.example.App".

## What should I run while developing?

This is a 3 tier architecture - Angular, Spring Boot, and MarkLogic - and thus, during development, there are 3 things you'll want to update and test, ideally without having to run a build task manually. Here's the best way to do that, IMO:

1. In one terminal window, run "gulp watch" to process changes under src/main/webapp.
2. In another terminal window, run "gradle bootRun". As of version 0.2.x, this will not only run Spring Boot, but a component in the webapp will automatically load new/modified MarkLogic modules, just like "gradle mlWatch". 

According to the Boot docs, you should be able to change Java code, and Boot will reload if you have Boot's devtools library on the classpath. I have not had good luck with that yet. But changing Java code is infrequent, and so far, it's not a big deal to just re-run this task after changing Java code. 

I have had luck with Boot restarting when running Boot in Eclipse, but it restarts more often than I want it to - I haven't looked into trying to configure when it should restart and when it should not.

For now, I'd stick with "gradle bootRun" from the command line. 

## Why Spring Boot?

1. Most importantly, because you want a Java middle tier. If you don't want a Java middle tier, don't use this generator!
2. Spring Boot is one of the fastest, easiest ways to get a webapp up and running with a Java middle tier.
3. Spring Boot supports packaging up the entire application as a single executable jar for easy deployment.
4. Spring Boot provides numerous features that may be useful for your web application.
5. Having a Java middle tier makes it easy to reuse MarkLogic libraries like mlcp and corb2.

## Integration points with Spring Boot

1. Spring Boot uses Spring Security for managing authentication; the generated project by default uses a form login for authentication and passes the credentials through to MarkLogic for verification.
2. Requests from Angular to the MarkLogic REST API are proxied via a Spring MVC controller.
3. The Gulp build file is a minimal approach for deploying everything to the src/main/resources/templates and src/main/resources/static directories - where Spring Boot expects to find static content.

## Notes about Gradle

1. Most ml-gradle properties are in src/main/resources/application.properties to avoid duplication in gradle.properties. 
That's the file that Spring Boot reads from for application properties.
2. For support with environment-sensitive properties, look into the commented-out Gradle properties plugin in bild.gradle.

## How do I remove the map?

As of version 0.4.0, an Esri-based map is included in the UI, along with some code in the modules database to support it.
If you don't want this map, the easiest thing to do is comment it out in search.html and then comment out the
related parts in search.controller.js. Also comment out the Esri JS/CSS files in index.html. That will prevent the app
from doing any unnecessary work to try to power a map that you don't want. 

## Getting To Know Slush

Slush is a tool that uses Gulp for project scaffolding.

Slush does not contain anything "out of the box", except the ability to locate installed slush generators and to run them with liftoff.

To find out more about Slush, check out the [documentation](https://github.com/slushjs/slush).
